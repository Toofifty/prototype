game play

    start with no weapon, punch only
    player has levels, gets xp from killing enemies
    caches spread in random places around the map
    caches contain guns and items, all randomly generated
    higher level == higher powered guns and items
    first cache always contains a gun ?
    low chance of getting a gun upgrade

    game continually scales up, enemies scaling to level (not weapon)

    boss room in each level, survive N waves before boss appears

plot

    humans on earth are about to be exterminated by GUARDIAN,
    a race of mechs that are the 'galactic police', for some
    unknown reason. scientists in an orbiting ship that hasn't
    been noticed need to figure out a way to stop GUARDIAN.
    they have 3 'iter' robots (classes) that they can send to exo-planets
    to test and upgrade. if the robot fails the test it is reset
    back to the last sync point, with the items it had at that point
    (no coins or gun). the entire map is set to how it was at
    that point too, so the player can attempt a different tactic in
    the same scenario. once the iter has successfully survived 3 planets,
    it is ready to attempt to save earth, and kill the GUARDIAN hive mind.

    items are software upgrades, whereas guns are physical hardware and
    can't be copied. this explains why when getting re synced (respawning)
    only items are retained. a default gun and 100p are provided, however

guns

    hold 2 guns at once, allows efficient use of healing/low ammo guns

    3 gun pieces

    random textures for each, stitched together at runtime

    grip - magazine - barrel

    grip
        fire rate - single, 3 burst, full auto

    magazine
        amount of ammo, dependent on type of gun

    barrel
        type of gun - rocket launcher, shotgun, assault rifle

    only items and rare gun upgrades change regular gun behaviour.
    i.e.
    tracking rounds
    poison tips
    incendiary shots
    morphine darts

    gun upgrades apply to only the current gun held, and can't be removed

currency

    all enemies drop some platinum on death
    can also be a reward from chests
    option to buy from a choice of items at a trader (expensive)
    sell items to a trader for silver pennies (cheap)
